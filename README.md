🛠️ Skills Acquired:

Pure JavaScript: Working with JavaScript without external dependencies.

🖥️ DOM Manipulation: Interacting with HTML elements to update the user interface.

🔄 CRUD Operations: Implementing basic data manipulation operations.

💾 Local Storage: Saving data in local storage for note persistence.

⌨️ Event Handling: Managing user interactions (clicks, keyboard inputs).
